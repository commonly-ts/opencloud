   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/relatiocc/opencloud.git
   cd opencloud
   ```
3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/relatiocc/opencloud.git
   ```

## Development Setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Build the project:

   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

3. Run tests to ensure everything is working:

## Development Workflow

### Creating a New Branch

Always create a new branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

Branch naming conventions:

- `feature/` - for new features
- `fix/` - for bug fixes
- `docs/` - for documentation changes
- `refactor/` - for code refactoring
- `test/` - for test additions or modifications

### Making Changes

1. **Write your code** following our [coding standards](#coding-standards)
2. **Add tests** for any new functionality
3. **Update documentation** if you're changing APIs or adding features
4. **Run the test suite** to ensure everything passes

### Available Scripts

- `pnpm build` - Build the project
- `pnpm test` - Run tests once
- `pnpm test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `pnpm coverage` - Generate test coverage report
- `pnpm typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint
- `pnpm lint:format` - Check code formatting
- `pnpm format` - Format code with Prettier
- `pnpm docs` - Generate documentation
- `pnpm docs:watch` - Generate documentation in watch mode

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all code
- Enable strict type checking
- Avoid `any` types when possible
- Export all public types and interfaces
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Code Style

This project uses ESLint and Prettier for code style enforcement:

```bash
# Check formatting
pnpm lint:format

# Fix formatting issues
pnpm format

# Check linting
pnpm lint
```

### Type Definitions

- All API resources should have corresponding TypeScript interfaces
- Types should be exported from `src/types/index.ts`
- Use JSDoc comments for all public APIs

### Example Code Style

````typescript
/**
 * Fetches user information by user ID.
 *
 * @param userId - The Roblox user ID
 * @returns User information
 * @throws {OpenCloudError} If the API request fails
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const user = await client.users.get("123456789");
 * console.log(user.displayName);
 * ```
 */
async get(userId: string): Promise<User> {
  // Implementation
}
````

## Testing

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in the `test/` directory
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Mock external API calls
- Use the utilities in `test/_utils.ts` for common test setup

### Test Structure

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";

describe("Feature Name", () => {
  it("should do something specific", () => {
    // Arrange
    const input = "test";

    // Act
    const result = functionToTest(input);

    // Assert
    expect(result).toBe("expected");
  });
});
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Generate coverage report
pnpm coverage
```

### Coverage Requirements

- Aim for high test coverage (>80%)
- All new features must include tests
- Bug fixes should include regression tests

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Use JSDoc comments for all public APIs
- Include parameter descriptions, return types, and examples
- Document error cases with `@throws`

### TypeDoc

This project uses TypeDoc to generate documentation:

```bash
# Generate documentation
pnpm docs

# Generate documentation in watch mode
pnpm docs:watch
```

## Submitting Changes

3. **Push your changes**:

   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

4. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub:
   - Provide a clear title and description
   - Reference any related issues
   - Explain what changes you made and why
   - Include screenshots or examples if applicable

5. **Address review feedback**:
   - Respond to all comments

### Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting a PR, ensure:

- [ ] Code follows the project's style guidelines
- [ ] Tests have been added/updated and pass
- [ ] Documentation has been updated
- [ ] Type checking passes (`pnpm typecheck`)
- [ ] Linting passes (`pnpm lint`)

## Release Process

This project uses [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) for automated releases. The release process is handled automatically based on commit messages:

- `fix:` commits trigger patch releases (1.0.x)
- `feat:` commits trigger minor releases (1.x.0)
- `BREAKING CHANGE:` in commit body triggers major releases (x.0.0)

Contributors don't need to worry about versioning - it's handled automatically when PRs are merged to main.

## Getting Help

If you have questions or need help:

1. Check existing [issues](https://github.com/relatiocc/opencloud/issues)
2. Review the [documentation](https://opencloud.relatio.cc)
3. Open a new issue with your question

## Recognition
